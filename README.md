# Python Project Documentation With MkDocs

In this project, I quickly build documentation for a Python package based on Markdown files and docstrings using MkDocs and mkdocstrings.

I created a partly auto-generated documentation for a Python project by linking information in the docstrings to the documentation pages. Furthermore, I added additional documentation pages that made my project more appealing to users by guiding them through examples and use cases.

I styled the documentation with the Material for MkDocs theme and deployed it to the Internet through GitHub Pagesâ€”[here](https://ktreharrison.github.io/calculator/).

The main skills I practiced:

- Write docstrings for your code objects
- Work with MkDocs to produce static pages from Markdown
- Pull in code documentation from docstrings using mkdocstrings
- Follow best practices for project documentation
- Customize your documentation using the Material for MkDocs theme
- Deploy your documentation on GitHub Pages

Building a project documentation using MkDocs and mkdocstrings allows you to write Markdown and auto-generate parts of the documentation directly from your - docstrings. This setup means that you can create excellent documentation with less effort.
